the first book of moses  called genesis


 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth

 and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon
the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the
waters

 and god said let there be light and there was light

 and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light
from the darkness

 and god called the light day and the darkness he called night
and the evening and the morning were the first day

 and god said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters
and let it divide the waters from the waters

 and god made the firmament and divided the waters which were
under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament
and it was so

 and god called the firmament heaven and the evening and the
morning were the second day

 and god said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together
unto one place and let the dry land appear and it was so

 and god called the dry land earth and the gathering together of
the waters called he seas and god saw that it was good

 and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding
seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is
in itself upon the earth and it was so

 and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after
his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after
his kind and god saw that it was good

 and the evening and the morning were the third day

 and god said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven
to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for
seasons and for days and years  and let them be for lights in
the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was
so

 and god made two great lights the greater light to rule the day
and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also

 and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light
upon the earth  and to rule over the day and over the night and
to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that it was good

 and the evening and the morning were the fourth day

 and god said let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
creature that hath life and fowl that may fly above the earth in the
open firmament of heaven

 and god created great whales and every living creature that
moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind
and every winged fowl after his kind and god saw that it was good

 and god blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply and fill
the waters in the seas and let fowl multiply in the earth

 and the evening and the morning were the fifth day

 and god said let the earth bring forth the living creature after
his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his
kind and it was so

 and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle
after their kind and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after
his kind and god saw that it was good

 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness
and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl
of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over
every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth

 so god created man in his own image in the image of god created
he him male and female created he them

 and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and
multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion
over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every
living thing that moveth upon the earth

 and god said behold i have given you every herb bearing seed
which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in the which
is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat

 and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air
and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is
life i have given every green herb for meat and it was so

 and god saw every thing that he had made and behold it was
very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day

 thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of
them

 and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and
he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made

 and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that
in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made

 these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
they were created in the day that the lord god made the earth and the
heavens  and every plant of the field before it was in the earth
and every herb of the field before it grew for the lord god had not
caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the
ground

 but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole
face of the ground

 and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living
soul

 and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he
put the man whom he had formed

 and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is
pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the
midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil

 and a river went out of eden to water the garden and from thence
it was parted and became into four heads

 the name of the first is pison that is it which compasseth the
whole land of havilah where there is gold  and the gold of that
land is good there is bdellium and the onyx stone

 and the name of the second river is gihon the same is it that
compasseth the whole land of ethiopia

 and the name of the third river is hiddekel that is it which
goeth toward the east of assyria and the fourth river is euphrates

 and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of
eden to dress it and to keep it

 and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the
garden thou mayest freely eat  but of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die

 and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be
alone i will make him an help meet for him

 and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the
field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see
what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living
creature that was the name thereof

 and adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air
and to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found an
help meet for him

 and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he
slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead
thereof  and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made
he a woman and brought her unto the man

 and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my
flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man

 therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall
cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh

 and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not
ashamed

 now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which
the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said
ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden   and the woman said
unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden
 but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden
god hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest
ye die

 and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die 
for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall
be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil

 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that
it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one
wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto
her husband with her and he did eat

 and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they
were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves
aprons

 and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in
the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the
presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden

 and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art
thou   and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was
afraid because i was naked and i hid myself

 and he said who told thee that thou wast naked hast thou eaten
of the tree whereof i commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat
 and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she
gave me of the tree and i did eat

 and the lord god said unto the woman what is this that thou hast
done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat

 and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast done
this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the
field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the
days of thy life  and i will put enmity between thee and the
woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head
and thou shalt bruise his heel

 unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy
desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee

 and unto adam he said because thou hast hearkened unto the voice
of thy wife and hast eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee
saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake
in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life  thorns
also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the
herb of the field  in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread
till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for
dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return

 and adam called his wife's name eve because she was the mother
of all living

 unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of
skins and clothed them

 and the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us to
know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also
of the tree of life and eat and live for ever  therefore the
lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground
from whence he was taken

 so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden
of eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep
the way of the tree of life

 and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bare cain and
said i have gotten a man from the lord

 and she again bare his brother abel and abel was a keeper of
sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground

 and in process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the
fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord

 and abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of
the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his
offering  but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect
and cain was very wroth and his countenance fell

 and the lord said unto cain why art thou wroth and why is thy
countenance fallen   if thou doest well shalt thou not be
accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto
thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him

 and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when
they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother
and slew him

 and the lord said unto cain where is abel thy brother and he
said i know not am i my brother's keeper   and he said what
hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from
the ground

 and now art thou cursed from the earth which hath opened her
mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand  when thou
tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her
strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth

 and cain said unto the lord my punishment is greater than i can
bear

 behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the
earth and from thy face shall i be hid and i shall be a fugitive and
a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that every one
that findeth me shall slay me

 and the lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth cain
vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold and the lord set a mark
upon cain lest any finding him should kill him

 and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the
land of nod on the east of eden

 and cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare enoch and he
builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his
son enoch

 and unto enoch was born irad and irad begat mehujael and
mehujael begat methusael and methusael begat lamech

 and lamech took unto him two wives the name of the one was adah
and the name of the other zillah

 and adah bare jabal he was the father of such as dwell in tents
and of such as have cattle

 and his brother's name was jubal he was the father of all such
as handle the harp and organ

 and zillah she also bare tubalcain an instructer of every
artificer in brass and iron and the sister of tubalcain was naamah

 and lamech said unto his wives adah and zillah hear my voice
ye wives of lamech hearken unto my speech for i have slain a man to
my wounding and a young man to my hurt

 if cain shall be avenged sevenfold truly lamech seventy and
sevenfold

 and adam knew his wife again and she bare a son and called his
name seth for god said she hath appointed me another seed instead
of abel whom cain slew

 and to seth to him also there was born a son and he called his
name enos then began men to call upon the name of the lord

 this is the book of the generations of adam in the day that god
created man in the likeness of god made he him  male and female
created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the
day when they were created

 and adam lived an hundred and thirty years and begat a son in his
own likeness and after his image and called his name seth  and
the days of adam after he had begotten seth were eight hundred years
and he begat sons and daughters  and all the days that adam lived
were nine hundred and thirty years and he died

 and seth lived an hundred and five years and begat enos  and
seth lived after he begat enos eight hundred and seven years and
begat sons and daughters  and all the days of seth were nine
hundred and twelve years and he died

 and enos lived ninety years and begat cainan  and enos lived
after he begat cainan eight hundred and fifteen years and begat sons
and daughters  and all the days of enos were nine hundred and
five years and he died

 and cainan lived seventy years and begat mahalaleel  and
cainan lived after he begat mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years
and begat sons and daughters  and all the days of cainan were
nine hundred and ten years and he died

 and mahalaleel lived sixty and five years and begat jared 
and mahalaleel lived after he begat jared eight hundred and thirty
years and begat sons and daughters  and all the days of
mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years and he died

 and jared lived an hundred sixty and two years and he begat
enoch  and jared lived after he begat enoch eight hundred years
and begat sons and daughters  and all the days of jared were nine
hundred sixty and two years and he died

 and enoch lived sixty and five years and begat methuselah 
and enoch walked with god after he begat methuselah three hundred
years and begat sons and daughters  and all the days of enoch
were three hundred sixty and five years  and enoch walked with
god and he was not for god took him

 and methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years and begat
lamech

 and methuselah lived after he begat lamech seven hundred eighty
and two years and begat sons and daughters  and all the days of
methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years and he died

 and lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years and begat a
son  and he called his name noah saying this same shall comfort
us concerning our work and toil of our hands because of the ground
which the lord hath cursed

 and lamech lived after he begat noah five hundred ninety and five
years and begat sons and daughters  and all the days of lamech
were seven hundred seventy and seven years and he died

 and noah was five hundred years old and noah begat shem ham
and japheth

 and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the
earth and daughters were born unto them  that the sons of god saw
the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of
all which they chose

 and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for
that he also is flesh yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty
years

 there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that
when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bare
children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of
renown

 and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and
that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
continually

 and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it
grieved him at his heart

 and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the
face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and
the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that i have made them

 but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord

 these are the generations of noah noah was a just man and perfect
in his generations and noah walked with god

 and noah begat three sons shem ham and japheth

 the earth also was corrupt before god and the earth was filled
with violence

 and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for
all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth

 and god said unto noah the end of all flesh is come before me
for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i
will destroy them with the earth

 make thee an ark of gopher wood rooms shalt thou make in the
ark and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch

 and this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of the length
of the ark shall be three hundred cubits the breadth of it fifty
cubits and the height of it thirty cubits

 a window shalt thou make to the ark and in a cubit shalt thou
finish it above and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side
thereof with lower second and third stories shalt thou make it

 and behold i even i do bring a flood of waters upon the
earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under
heaven and every thing that is in the earth shall die

 but with thee will i establish my covenant and thou shalt come
into the ark thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy sons' wives
with thee

 and of every living thing of all flesh two of every sort shalt
thou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee they shall be
male and female

 of fowls after their kind and of cattle after their kind of
every creeping thing of the earth after his kind two of every sort
shall come unto thee to keep them alive

 and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten and thou shalt
gather it to thee and it shall be for food for thee and for them

 thus did noah according to all that god commanded him so did
he

 and the lord said unto noah come thou and all thy house into the
ark for thee have i seen righteous before me in this generation

 of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens the male
and his female and of beasts that are not clean by two the male and
his female

 of fowls also of the air by sevens the male and the female to
keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth

 for yet seven days and i will cause it to rain upon the earth
forty days and forty nights and every living substance that i have
made will i destroy from off the face of the earth

 and noah did according unto all that the lord commanded him

 and noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was
upon the earth

 and noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives
with him into the ark because of the waters of the flood

 of clean beasts and of beasts that are not clean and of fowls
and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth  there went in two
and two unto noah into the ark the male and the female as god had
commanded noah

 and it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the
flood were upon the earth

 in the six hundredth year of noah's life in the second month
the seventeenth day of the month the same day were all the fountains
of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened

 and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights

 in the selfsame day entered noah and shem and ham and japheth
the sons of noah and noah's wife and the three wives of his sons
with them into the ark  they and every beast after his kind
and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that
creepeth upon the earth after his kind and every fowl after his kind
every bird of every sort

 and they went in unto noah into the ark two and two of all
flesh wherein is the breath of life

 and they that went in went in male and female of all flesh as
god had commanded him and the lord shut him in

 and the flood was forty days upon the earth and the waters
increased and bare up the ark and it was lift up above the earth

 and the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the
earth and the ark went upon the face of the waters

 and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the
high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered

 fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail and the mountains
were covered

 and all flesh died that moved upon the earth both of fowl and
of cattle and of beast and of every creeping thing that creepeth
upon the earth and every man  all in whose nostrils was the
breath of life of all that was in the dry land died

 and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face
of the ground both man and cattle and the creeping things and the
fowl of the heaven and they were destroyed from the earth and noah
only remained alive and they that were with him in the ark

 and the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
days

 and god remembered noah and every living thing and all the
cattle that was with him in the ark and god made a wind to pass over
the earth and the waters asswaged  the fountains also of the deep
and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain from heaven was
restrained  and the waters returned from off the earth
continually and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the
waters were abated

 and the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day of
the month upon the mountains of ararat

 and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month in the
tenth month on the first day of the month were the tops of the
mountains seen

 and it came to pass at the end of forty days that noah opened the
window of the ark which he had made  and he sent forth a raven
which went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from off
the earth

 also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were
abated from off the face of the ground  but the dove found no rest
for the sole of her foot and she returned unto him into the ark for
the waters were on the face of the whole earth then he put forth his
hand and took her and pulled her in unto him into the ark

 and he stayed yet other seven days and again he sent forth the
dove out of the ark  and the dove came in to him in the evening
and lo in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off so noah knew that
the waters were abated from off the earth

 and he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove
which returned not again unto him any more

 and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year in the
first month the first day of the month the waters were dried up from
off the earth and noah removed the covering of the ark and looked
and behold the face of the ground was dry

 and in the second month on the seven and twentieth day of the
month was the earth dried

 and god spake unto noah saying  go forth of the ark thou
and thy wife and thy sons and thy sons' wives with thee

 bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of
all flesh both of fowl and of cattle and of every creeping thing
that creepeth upon the earth that they may breed abundantly in the
earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth

 and noah went forth and his sons and his wife and his sons'
wives with him  every beast every creeping thing and every
fowl and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth after their kinds went
forth out of the ark

 and noah builded an altar unto the lord and took of every clean
beast and of every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings on the
altar

 and the lord smelled a sweet savour and the lord said in his
heart i will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake for
the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth neither will i
again smite any more every thing living as i have done

 while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and
heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease

 and god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them be
fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth

 and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast
of the earth and upon every fowl of the air upon all that moveth
upon the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand are
they delivered

 every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you even as the
green herb have i given you all things

 but flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall
ye not eat

 and surely your blood of your lives will i require at the hand of
every beast will i require it and at the hand of man at the hand of
every man's brother will i require the life of man

 whoso sheddeth man's blood by man shall his blood be shed for in
the image of god made he man

 and you be ye fruitful and multiply bring forth abundantly in
the earth and multiply therein

 and god spake unto noah and to his sons with him saying  and
i behold i establish my covenant with you and with your seed after
you  and with every living creature that is with you of the
fowl of the cattle and of every beast of the earth with you from
all that go out of the ark to every beast of the earth

 and i will establish my covenant with you neither shall all
flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood neither shall
there any more be a flood to destroy the earth

 and god said this is the token of the covenant which i make
between me and you and every living creature that is with you for
perpetual generations  i do set my bow in the cloud and it shall
be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth

 and it shall come to pass when i bring a cloud over the earth
that the bow shall be seen in the cloud  and i will remember my
covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all
flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all
flesh

 and the bow shall be in the cloud and i will look upon it that
i may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living
creature of all flesh that is upon the earth

 and god said unto noah this is the token of the covenant which
i have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth

 and the sons of noah that went forth of the ark were shem and
ham and japheth and ham is the father of canaan

 these are the three sons of noah and of them was the whole earth
overspread

 and noah began to be an husbandman and he planted a vineyard
 and he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered
within his tent

 and ham the father of canaan saw the nakedness of his father
and told his two brethren without

 and shem and japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their
shoulders and went backward and covered the nakedness of their
father and their faces were backward and they saw not their father's
nakedness

 and noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son had
done unto him

 and he said cursed be canaan a servant of servants shall he be
unto his brethren

 and he said blessed be the lord god of shem and canaan shall be
his servant

 god shall enlarge japheth and he shall dwell in the tents of
shem and canaan shall be his servant

 and noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years

 and all the days of noah were nine hundred and fifty years and
he died

 now these are the generations of the sons of noah shem ham and
japheth and unto them were sons born after the flood

 the sons of japheth gomer and magog and madai and javan and
tubal and meshech and tiras

 and the sons of gomer ashkenaz and riphath and togarmah

 and the sons of javan elishah and tarshish kittim and
dodanim

 by these were the isles of the gentiles divided in their lands
every one after his tongue after their families in their nations

 and the sons of ham cush and mizraim and phut and canaan

 and the sons of cush seba and havilah and sabtah and raamah
and sabtechah and the sons of raamah sheba and dedan

 and cush begat nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth

 he was a mighty hunter before the lord wherefore it is said
even as nimrod the mighty hunter before the lord

 and the beginning of his kingdom was babel and erech and
accad and calneh in the land of shinar

 out of that land went forth asshur and builded nineveh and the
city rehoboth and calah  and resen between nineveh and calah
the same is a great city

 and mizraim begat ludim and anamim and lehabim and naphtuhim
 and pathrusim and casluhim (out of whom came philistim) and
caphtorim

 and canaan begat sidon his first born and heth  and the
jebusite and the amorite and the girgasite  and the hivite
and the arkite and the sinite  and the arvadite and the
zemarite and the hamathite and afterward were the families of the
canaanites spread abroad

 and the border of the canaanites was from sidon as thou comest
to gerar unto gaza as thou goest unto sodom and gomorrah and
admah and zeboim even unto lasha

 these are the sons of ham after their families after their
tongues in their countries and in their nations

 unto shem also the father of all the children of eber the
brother of japheth the elder even to him were children born

 the children of shem elam and asshur and arphaxad and lud
and aram

 and the children of aram uz and hul and gether and mash

 and arphaxad begat salah and salah begat eber

 and unto eber were born two sons the name of one was peleg for
in his days was the earth divided and his brother's name was joktan

 and joktan begat almodad and sheleph and hazarmaveth and
jerah  and hadoram and uzal and diklah  and obal and
abimael and sheba  and ophir and havilah and jobab all these
were the sons of joktan

 and their dwelling was from mesha as thou goest unto sephar a
mount of the east

 these are the sons of shem after their families after their
tongues in their lands after their nations

 these are the families of the sons of noah after their
generations in their nations and by these were the nations divided
in the earth after the flood

 and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech

 and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they
found a plain in the land of shinar and they dwelt there

 and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn
them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for
morter

 and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose
top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be
scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth

 and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the
children of men builded

 and the lord said behold the people is one and they have all
one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be
restrained from them which they have imagined to do

 go to let us go down and there confound their language that
they may not understand one another's speech

 so the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of
all the earth and they left off to build the city

 therefore is the name of it called babel because the lord did
there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the
lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth

 these are the generations of shem shem was an hundred years
old and begat arphaxad two years after the flood  and shem

 and terah lived seventy years and begat abram nahor and

 now these are the generations of terah terah begat abram
nahor and haran and haran begat lot

 and haran died before his father terah in the land of his
nativity in ur of the chaldees

 and abram and nahor took them wives the name of abram's wife
was sarai and the name of nahor's wife milcah the daughter of
haran the father of milcah and the father of iscah

 but sarai was barren she had no child

 and terah took abram his son and lot the son of haran his son's
son and sarai his daughter in law his son abram's wife and they
went forth with them from ur of the chaldees to go into the land of
canaan and they came unto haran and dwelt there

 and the days of terah were two hundred and five years and terah
died in haran

 now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country
and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i
will shew thee  and i will make of thee a great nation and i
will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a
blessing  and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him
that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be
blessed

 so abram departed as the lord had spoken unto him and lot went
with him and abram was seventy and five years old when he departed
out of haran

 and abram took sarai his wife and lot his brother's son and all
their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had
gotten in haran and they went forth to go into the land of canaan
and into the land of canaan they came

 and abram passed through the land unto the place of sichem unto
the plain of moreh and the canaanite was then in the land

 and the lord appeared unto abram and said unto thy seed will i
give this land and there builded he an altar unto the lord who
appeared unto him

 and he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of bethel
and pitched his tent having bethel on the west and hai on the east
and there he builded an altar unto the lord and called upon the name
of the lord

 and abram journeyed going on still toward the south

 and there was a famine in the land and abram went down into
egypt to sojourn there for the famine was grievous in the land

 and it came to pass when he was come near to enter into egypt
that he said unto sarai his wife behold now i know that thou art a
fair woman to look upon  therefore it shall come to pass when
the egyptians shall see thee that they shall say this is his wife
and they will kill me but they will save thee alive

 say i pray thee thou art my sister that it may be well with
me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of thee

 and it came to pass that when abram was come into egypt the
egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair

 the princes also of pharaoh saw her and commended her before
pharaoh and the woman was taken into pharaoh's house

 and he entreated abram well for her sake and he had sheep and
oxen and he asses and menservants and maidservants and she asses
and camels

 and the lord plagued pharaoh and his house with great plagues
because of sarai abram's wife

 and pharaoh called abram and said what is this that thou hast
done unto me why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife  
why saidst thou she is my sister so i might have taken her to me to
wife now therefore behold thy wife take her and go thy way

 and pharaoh commanded his men concerning him and they sent him
away and his wife and all that he had

 and abram went up out of egypt he and his wife and all that he
had and lot with him into the south

 and abram was very rich in cattle in silver and in gold

 and he went on his journeys from the south even to bethel unto
the place where his tent had been at the beginning between bethel and
hai  unto the place of the altar which he had make there at the
first and there abram called on the name of the lord

 and lot also which went with abram had flocks and herds and
tents

 and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell
together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell
together

 and there was a strife between the herdmen of abram's cattle and
the herdmen of lot's cattle and the canaanite and the perizzite
dwelled then in the land

 and abram said unto lot let there be no strife i pray thee
between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we be
brethren

 is not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee
from me if thou wilt take the left hand then i will go to the right
or if thou depart to the right hand then i will go to the left

 and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of jordan
that it was well watered every where before the lord destroyed sodom
and gomorrah even as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt
as thou comest unto zoar

 then lot chose him all the plain of jordan and lot journeyed
east and they separated themselves the one from the other

 abram dwelled in the land of canaan and lot dwelled in the
cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward sodom

 but the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord
exceedingly

 and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from
him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art
northward and southward and eastward and westward  for all
the land which thou seest to thee will i give it and to thy seed for
ever

 and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a
man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be
numbered

 arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the
breadth of it for i will give it unto thee

 then abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of
mamre which is in hebron and built there an altar unto the lord

 and it came to pass in the days of amraphel king of shinar
arioch king of ellasar chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of
nations  that these made war with bera king of sodom and with
birsha king of gomorrah shinab king of admah and shemeber king of
zeboiim and the king of bela which is zoar

 all these were joined together in the vale of siddim which is
the salt sea

 twelve years they served chedorlaomer and in the thirteenth year
they rebelled

 and in the fourteenth year came chedorlaomer and the kings that
were with him and smote the rephaims in ashteroth karnaim and the
zuzims in ham and the emins in shaveh kiriathaim  and the
horites in their mount seir unto elparan which is by the wilderness

 and they returned and came to enmishpat which is kadesh and
smote all the country of the amalekites and also the amorites that
dwelt in hazezontamar

 and there went out the king of sodom and the king of gomorrah
and the king of admah and the king of zeboiim and the king of bela
(the same is zoar) and they joined battle with them in the vale of
siddim  with chedorlaomer the king of elam and with tidal king
of nations and amraphel king of shinar and arioch king of ellasar
four kings with five

 and the vale of siddim was full of slimepits and the kings of
sodom and gomorrah fled and fell there and they that remained fled
to the mountain

 and they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah and all their
victuals and went their way

 and they took lot abram's brother's son who dwelt in sodom
and his goods and departed

 and there came one that had escaped and told abram the hebrew
for he dwelt in the plain of mamre the amorite brother of eshcol and
brother of aner and these were confederate with abram

 and when abram heard that his brother was taken captive he
armed his trained servants born in his own house three hundred and
eighteen and pursued them unto dan

 and he divided himself against them he and his servants by
night and smote them and pursued them unto hobah which is on the
left hand of damascus

 and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his
brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people

 and the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return from
the slaughter of chedorlaomer and of the kings that were with him at
the valley of shaveh which is the king's dale

 and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and
he was the priest of the most high god

 and he blessed him and said blessed be abram of the most high
god possessor of heaven and earth  and blessed be the most high
god which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him
tithes of all

 and the king of sodom said unto abram give me the persons and
take the goods to thyself

 and abram said to the king of sodom i have lift up mine hand
unto the lord the most high god the possessor of heaven and earth
 that i will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet and
that i will not take any thing that is thine lest thou shouldest say
i have made abram rich  save only that which the young men have
eaten and the portion of the men which went with me aner eshcol
and mamre let them take their portion

 after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a
vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding
great reward

 and abram said lord god what wilt thou give me seeing i go
childless and the steward of my house is this eliezer of damascus
 and abram said behold to me thou hast given no seed and lo
one born in my house is mine heir

 and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying this
shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own
bowels shall be thine heir

 and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward
heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he
said unto him so shall thy seed be

 and he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for
righteousness

 and he said unto him i am the lord that brought thee out of ur
of the chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it

 and he said lord god whereby shall i know that i shall inherit
it   and he said unto him take me an heifer of three years old
and a she goat of three years old and a ram of three years old and a
turtledove and a young pigeon

 and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst
and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he not

 and when the fowls came down upon the carcases abram drove them
away

 and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon abram
and lo an horror of great darkness fell upon him

 and he said unto abram know of a surety that thy seed shall be
a stranger in a land that is not their's and shall serve them and
they shall afflict them four hundred years  and also that
nation whom they shall serve will i judge and afterward shall they
come out with great substance

 and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buried
in a good old age

 but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for
the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full

 and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was
dark behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between
those pieces

 in the same day the lord made a covenant with abram saying
unto thy seed have i given this land from the river of egypt unto the
great river the river euphrates  the kenites and the
kenizzites and the kadmonites  and the hittites and the
perizzites and the rephaims  and the amorites and the
canaanites and the girgashites and the jebusites

 now sarai abram's wife bare him no children and she had an
handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar

 and sarai said unto abram behold now the lord hath restrained
me from bearing i pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that i may
obtain children by her and abram hearkened to the voice of sarai

 and sarai abram's wife took hagar her maid the egyptian after
abram had dwelt ten years in the land of canaan and gave her to her
husband abram to be his wife

 and he went in unto hagar and she conceived and when she saw
that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes

 and sarai said unto abram my wrong be upon thee i have given my
maid into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived i was
despised in her eyes the lord judge between me and thee

 but abram said unto sarai behold thy maid is in thine hand do
to her as it pleaseth thee and when sarai dealt hardly with her she
fled from her face

 and the angel of the lord found her by a fountain of water in the
wilderness by the fountain in the way to shur

 and he said hagar sarai's maid whence camest thou and whither
wilt thou go and she said i flee from the face of my mistress sarai

 and the angel of the lord said unto her return to thy mistress
and submit thyself under her hands

 and the angel of the lord said unto her i will multiply thy
seed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitude

 and the angel of the lord said unto her behold thou art with
child and shalt bear a son and shalt call his name ishmael because
the lord hath heard thy affliction

 and he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man
and every man's hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence
of all his brethren

 and she called the name of the lord that spake unto her thou
god seest me for she said have i also here looked after him that
seeth me   wherefore the well was called beerlahairoi behold
it is between kadesh and bered

 and hagar bare abram a son and abram called his son's name
which hagar bare ishmael

 and abram was fourscore and six years old when hagar bare
ishmael to abram

 and when abram was ninety years old and nine the lord appeared
to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me
and be thou perfect

 and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will
multiply thee exceedingly

 and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying 
as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a
father of many nations

 neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name
shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee

 and i will make thee exceeding fruitful and i will make nations
of thee and kings shall come out of thee

 and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed
after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a
god unto thee and to thy seed after thee

 and i will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land
wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an
everlasting possession and i will be their god
